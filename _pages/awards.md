    <hr>

    <p>In 2022, I was recognized with two Outstanding Cambridge Learner Awards for my performance in the Cambridge International (GCE) AS & A-Level examinations.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Top in Country – Computer Science</h3>
    <h3 class="mt-4">Top in Country – Further Mathematics</h3>

    <blockquote class="mt-4">
      <p>The 'Top in Country' award refers to the learner who has gained the highest standard mark in their country for a single subject. There may be other learners in the country who scored exactly the same mark; since their achievement is equal they will receive equal recognition and will also be awarded the Cambridge 'Top in Country' award for that subject.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">This recognition is awarded based on achieving the highest standard mark, which reflects a consistent and high level of performance in the subject. The official award certificates can be provided upon request.</p>
