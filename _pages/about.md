I am a Computer Science and Mathematics student at New York University Abu Dhabi, passionate about machine learning and AI. My work focuses on building reliable and impactful technologies, from research in neural regression to developing practical AI-powered applications.

I have experience in both academic research and software development, contributing to projects in natural language processing and the Internet of Things (IoT). I enjoy tackling complex problems and am always eager to learn and grow.
