But what does <strong>well-constructed</strong> even mean? Is it necessarily a model that captures reality to the finest details? Surely such realistic models would have more to offer when compared to simple models that leave out variables that we know for sure affect the system to some degree?</p> <p>Is a human dummy a good model to represent a real, functioning human being? Or is a pig better than a mere dummy? At least a pig has life to it!</p> <p>I find this question interesting and quite revealing. Consider providing human dummies of various shapes and sizes to a budding fashion designer and he will make the most out of it. On the other hand, let a medical student practice surgery on pigs initially and she might emerge as a capable surgeon in the future. But now let’s swap the models provided to the fashion designer and surgeon. All of a sudden, a dummy model, which seemed so useful to a designer, turns out to be completely worthless for the medical student. Same goes for the designer. All in all, we would witness a humorous fashion disaster and a rather dangerous medical nightmare if the swap happened.</p> <p>What made all the difference here? In this case, it is pretty straightforward to see that the <strong>usefulness of a model depends on what purpose it serves</strong>. A model constructed without having specific objectives in mind is a quickfire recipe for disaster more often than not. Having a clarity of purpose then guides us to deciding what properties of the target system we desire to have in our model and what properties we can leave behind without much harm.</p> <p>All that a fashion designer wants in a human model is the correct body shape, while a surgeon would prefer models that closely reflect the human anatomy and organs, regardless of how the model looks on the outside. A human dummy model can have an outer shape analogous to that of human beings, but also several other features that we do not find in a human body. A similar statement can be made for pigs and other animals. While knowing what features a model and its target system shares is obviously important, it is as important to be clear about what features the model and its system do not share.</p> <h2 id="understanding-analogies-the-building-blocks-of-models">Understanding Analogies: The Building Blocks of Models</h2> <p>The classification of analogies, formulated by <strong>Mary Hesse</strong>, a British philosopher of science, could be helpful in better understanding this idea. Hesse classified analogies as <strong>positive</strong>, <strong>negative</strong> and <strong>neutral</strong> (Hesse).</p> <p>Simply put, <strong>positive analogies</strong> describe the ways in which a system and its model are similar. <strong>Negative analogies</strong> are the ways in which a system and its model are dissimilar. <strong>Neutral analogies</strong> are those which we cannot classify yet due to our limited knowledge, although we know for sure that they must be either positive or negative. This naturally implies that we know the properties of one of the two analogous entities better than the other.</p> <p>In the case of modeling, we draw certain positive analogies between a model and its target system. We also know for sure the negative analogies involved, which educate us about how not to apply the model to any scenario. However, because we understand our model way better than we understand the real-world, we might ask ourselves a question such as this:</p> <p><em>My model shows a property P. Since my model and the target system have a lot of strong positive analogies, could this mean that a property Q, similar/analogous to P, exists in the actual system?</em></p> <p>Just for the sake of an example, assume that we know very well about sound waves, perhaps because it is easier to produce, sample and analyze. We have identified some positive analogies between sound waves and light waves, namely that both kinds of waves have an associated wavelength, frequency and amplitude as observed from their pitch/color and loudness/brightness. However, we have also concluded via experiments that sound waves cannot be polarized while light waves can be polarized. This counts as a negative analogy.</p> <p>Now, we know that sound waves need a material medium for propagation. Assume that we do not yet know if this is true also for light waves. Then, this is an example of a neutral analogy. Today, we know that light waves, unlike sound waves, do not require any material medium for propagation and can travel through vacuum, i.e. we have sorted this neutral analogy as a negative analogy (Choi).</p> <h2 id="the-necessity-of-simplification">The Necessity of Simplification</h2> <p><strong>Simplifications and idealizations</strong> (such as assuming point masses, frictionless surfaces, massless springs), despite being held as negative analogies, are crucial for model building. On the other hand, a model that demonstrates strong positive analogies with its target system is called a more ‘realistic’ model.</p> <p>Humans throughout history have not remained absolutely limited to what they perceive through their five senses—we have constantly tried to model entities beyond our senses in some way. Otherwise, Dalton, Thompson, Rutherford and Bohr would not have proposed their models of what an atom is. While some might have given models that are more faithful to our experiments and observations, they all have essentially drawn analogies to objects we readily observe, like balls and watermelons (and their seeds), and abstract mathematical objects like points, circles and spheres (The History of the Atom).</p> <p>Now, an important question here is—<strong>how realistic can models get?</strong></p> <h2 id="models-vs-simulations-different-tools-for-different-jobs">Models vs Simulations: Different Tools for Different Jobs</h2> <p>Truth be told, it is not the aim of a mathematical model, in general, to replicate exactly a real-world situation by fitting in as much detail as possible. In a sense, it is rather the opposite—<strong>a good model should be as simple and general as possible</strong>. Complicating the model by crowding every little feature about the phenomenon we know of might make the model more realistic, but not necessarily better at what they are supposed to do.</p> <p>Well, there are certain models that try to make use of every information at its disposal to give a more realistic picture of the real-world phenomenon—we call them <strong>simulations</strong>. However, the utility of simulations differs greatly from that of other models. Simulations are mostly used in cases where we wish to understand the workings of a very particular system. As a result, simulations do not offer much help when it comes to generalizing the result in a broader context.</p> <p>For example: in order to decide a suitable design for a skyscraper that needs to meet the specifications as requested in some island in Abu Dhabi that experiences high heat and wind speeds, simulations are the perfect tool. However, we may not be able to generalize the simulation to this very particular situation easily to the construction of buildings in general. On the other hand, there can be some fundamental and general ideas relevant to all sorts of construction which can be expressed in the form of models.</p> <h2 id="platos-cave-our-eternal-modeling-predicament">Plato’s Cave: Our Eternal Modeling Predicament</h2> <p>This is a particularly striking question that has remained for a very long time, not just in the scientific community but also among philosophers. <strong>Plato</strong>, one of the founders of Western philosophy, strongly believed that what we experience in the real world through our senses is just a pale, shadowy imitation of the true reality, <strong>‘the realm of Ideas’</strong>, as he put it.</p> <p>In his famous <strong>allegory of the cave</strong>, Plato hypothesized a group of prisoners who were confined within a cave with no awareness that an external world even existed. They can only see the shadows cast from the external world, which for them is the true reality. However, one day, a prisoner managed to escape the cave and experience the external world: the trees, birds, humans, houses and so on. He then realized that what he experienced as reality inside the cave was far from being true (Whelan).</p> <p>Unfortunately for us though, <strong>there is no escape from the cave we live in</strong>. Having said so, it would be foolish of us to assume that what we experience is the purest form of reality. What should we do in such a situation then? Should we simply give up on our quest of trying to explain and understand reality in its truest form? Surely not!</p> <p>Modeling is our way as prisoners to try and replicate the shadows that are being casted from the outside with whatever resource we have. We have gotten progressively better and better at this, no doubt. But being able to reproduce shadows fairly accurately is not to mean that the objects we use and the object that is actually casting the shadow we aim to reproduce are the same.</p> <p>For instance, if I cast a shadow using an iPhone and my friend produces a nearly identical shadow, but using a Samsung phone of the same screen size, could one logically claim that the two phones must be the same just because the shadows they produce look the same? Surely, such a conclusion would be far from true.</p> <p>The delusion is pretty obvious in this case, but what some often fail to realize is that claiming to understand the true essence of reality through the use of models and theories is just as delusional. In my view, not just models, but there cannot exist any single entity that can objectively explain true reality in totality, its beauty, harmony and chaos. Of course, I am not referring to unfalsifiable theories but things whose correctness we can deduce through experiments, observations or other means. Thus, I am not hopeful of a grand unified theory of science in the future.</p> <h2 id="why-being-wrong-makes-models-right">Why Being Wrong Makes Models Right</h2> <p>Having said so, I am in no way undermining the immense value of models. In my view, knowing what not to expect from a model and how not to use it is crucial to take full advantage of their capabilities, whether it is explanatory, predictive or both. <strong>Models are useful for the same reason why they are false: they simplify things a lot and this is what gives them strength</strong>.</p> <p>Without simplifying things, models lose their explanatory power simply because of their failure to establish causal relationships among various interacting parts/variables of a system. Choosing the right variables to consider is not a matter of mere guesswork but a thoughtful process. When there are fewer moving parts to a system, we are in a better position to see what effect a particular variable has on the system.</p> <p>In this regard, even a poor model can be useful as it helps us assess how our models behave when certain variables are left out compared to models where those variables are included. After all, how likely is it that someone picks exactly the right variables during the modeling process in their first attempt?</p> <h2 id="the-value-of-modeling-chaos">The Value of Modeling Chaos</h2> <p>When models are capable of explaining observations, they can also be used as predictive tools depending on what kind of system is being represented. Of course, it does not make much sense to model a chaotic phenomenon and use the model in order to draw reliable predictions about the future. Thus, one should be mindful enough not to judge the value of a model solely based on its predictive power.</p> <p>But this does not mean that chaotic models simply cannot convey anything useful to us. While using chaotic models to predict an individual event might be useless, we can still picture their general behavior. It is similar to how scientists are not able to accurately predict the weather 30 days in advance, yet make claims about how the climate will behave in 30 years. In simple words, one must distinguish between an event and a statistics of a large number of events.</p> <p>The statistics of even chaotic or random events often exhibit characteristic patterns or features—uniform, normal, Poisson, binomial and geometric are some of the well-known distributions in this regard.</p> <p>For dynamical systems, a <strong>phase space</strong> is often constructed where each possible state of a system corresponds to a particular spatial location in a n-dimensional space. In the phase space could be various regions where most orbits get attracted towards—they could be fixed points, finite-period orbits or chaotic attractors in case of chaotic systems. One such chaotic attractor is the <strong>strange attractor</strong>, perhaps the most popular symbol or visual representation of chaos. Although we cannot exactly predict how an orbit will evolve over time for a chaotic system, we can still develop models that inform us about the attractors, repellers or other structures of potential interest.</p> <h2 id="context-is-everything-the-food-pyramid-example">Context is Everything: The Food Pyramid Example</h2> <p>A misconception that I would like to address is that more realistic models are necessarily better. I suppose we have all seen the pyramid diagram intended at guiding us to consuming a nutritious and balanced diet.</p> <p>This pyramid tells us a lot, but not everything. There are years of research and studies hidden behind this simple looking pyramid documented in the form of journals and research papers. Obviously, the abstract figure above misses a lot of information and we would surely learn a lot more by studying the research papers on food and nutrition. In a sense, those papers are more real and complete in comparison to this very basic diagram.</p> <p>However, which one do you find more effective in informing the general public about proper eating habits? What if now our target audience is a group of graduate students studying about human health and nutrition? Hopefully this clarifies why more abstract, less realistic models can often, but not always, be more useful or effective than the more realistic ones depending on what we intend to do with it.</p> <h2 id="models-as-knowledge-generators">Models as Knowledge Generators</h2> <p>Moreover, mathematical models are useful not only as tools to explain a phenomenon or predict its evolution, but also as <strong>tools for knowledge generation</strong>. In the pursuit of understanding a certain real-world phenomenon, asking the right questions plays an important role: a model can be of great help in this regard as well.</p> <p>Modeling is not a static process where we follow a sequence of steps and reach an end. Rather, we constantly question ourselves whether or not the model makes sense at each step. If it does not make sense at some point, we may have to revisit the earlier steps and make revisions to the model. When we gain new insights and knowledge from an existing model, several new hypotheses and questions usually arise out of that process.</p> <p>Even the discrepancies observed between the real-world phenomenon and the model can help generate more knowledge. As <strong>Kenneth E. Boulding</strong> said in <em>“Science: A Common Heritage”</em>, knowledge increases not only by the matching of images with the real world, that is, not by the direct perception of truth, but by the perception of error (Boulding). Thus, when we seek to explain the sources of discrepancies between the model and the real-world, even the unrealistic models—which most models are in fact—contribute to the advancement of knowledge.</p> <hr> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>To summarize, a recurring idea throughout this essay has been about not losing sight of the context in which a model is employed. <strong>There can be no context-free, objective assessment of the usefulness of a model</strong>. Likewise, predictive power alone is not the all-important criterion for a model to be deemed useful—modeling is still highly important in order to learn about chaotic dynamical systems, even though they pose an inherent limitation to our predictability in practice.</p> <p>Furthermore, we should constantly remind ourselves that modeling might not be as enjoyable and fruitful if exploring the true essence of reality is our end goal—models are simply not constructed for that reason. <strong>The value of models lies in their ability to help us make sense of what we experience through our senses</strong>, or the senses of our instruments, with whatever resources we have: after all, we cannot escape the cave and explore the outside like Plato’s prisoners could.</p> <p>Mathematical models are widely used across numerous fields including engineering, economics, natural sciences, political science, sociology, and beyond. They seek to explain why a natural system works the way it does and also make predictions about its future in appropriate cases. Thus, models can be utilized to make data-driven strategies in various contexts such as choosing the most cost-effective waste-management strategy for a city, deciding the price of a product so as to maximize revenue, and countless other applications.</p> <p>The beauty of models lies not in their perfection, but in their imperfection—their deliberate simplification of reality that allows us to see patterns, relationships, and insights that would otherwise be lost in the overwhelming complexity of the real world. In being wrong about the details, they become right about what matters most.</p> <hr> <h2 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h2> <p>Boulding, K.E. “Science: Our Common Heritage.” <em>Science</em> 207, no. 4433 (1980): 831-836.</p> <p>Box, George E.P. <em>Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces</em>.
