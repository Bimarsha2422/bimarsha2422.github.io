This project, developed for the NYU Graduate Deep Learning course taught by Yann LeCun and Alfredo Canziani, involved implementing a recurrent Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). The goal was to teach an agent to plan its navigation in environments containing obstacles.

A key component of this project was the development of a hybrid self-supervised learning approach that combined Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg) and Barlow Twins. This was crucial to prevent representational collapse and ensure the model learned meaningful features of the environment.

We experimented with a variety of neural network architectures to optimize the agent's performance, including:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Vision Transformers (ViTs)
- Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)

This project was recognized as one of the top 5 projects among 37 submissions in a class primarily composed of graduate students from the NYU Center for Data Science and the NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.
