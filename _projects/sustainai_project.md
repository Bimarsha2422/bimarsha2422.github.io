SustainAI is an AI-powered application that provides personalized sustainability recommendations through an interactive chatbot interface. The app also includes engagement features such as action tracking, streak systems, and educational content on sustainability topics.

A notable technical challenge was the integration of health app data. This was solved by creating custom MATLAB scripts to convert complex WAD (Walk Activity Data) files into structured text formats that could be processed by the application.

The application was built using React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, with the OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo API integrated for the chatbot functionality.

SustainAI was the winner of Amazon's GenAI Challenge at HackPrinceton 2024 and also won the Major League Hacking (MLH) award for Best Use of MATLAB at the same event. You can learn more about the project [here](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/19493).
