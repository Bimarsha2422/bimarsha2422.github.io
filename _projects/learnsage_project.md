LearnSageAI is a comprehensive learning platform that responsibly integrates AI to enhance education for both teachers and students. This project was developed for the NYUAD Slush'D AI Hackathon 2025, where it was selected as one of 12 finalists out of over 100 teams.

The platform features dual interfaces:
- **A teacher dashboard:** Provides AI-generated class reports to help improve pedagogical strategies.
- **A student workspace:** Offers personalized guidance and support.

Key features implemented include:
- Adaptive hints and step-by-step assistance
- LaTeX support for mathematical notation
- A drawing canvas for interactive problem-solving
- Session analytics to track learning progress

The project was built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS, with the goal of creating a positive AI intervention that benefits the entire educational ecosystem. You can find the project on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Bimarsha2422/slush-hackathon/tree/main).
